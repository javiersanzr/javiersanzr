# Hello everyone ğŸ˜„ ğŸ‘‹

I am a smily Software Developer born and raised in Valencia, Spain ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¸ , but currently based in Berlin, Germany ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª . I feel enthusiastic about building software for Apple platforms, but always open and keen to work with other technologies.

In my spare time, travelling the world and getting close to people from different cultures and backgrounds makes me feel full of energy. I also love practicing numerous sports, playing videogames and enjoying a cold beer surrounded by friends and family.
