# Hello everyone ðŸ˜„ ðŸ‘‹

I am a smily Software Developer born and raised in Valencia, Spain ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ , but currently based in Berlin, Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª . I feel enthusiastic about building software for Apple platforms, but always open and keen to work with other technologies. Currently I am professionally committed to create a secure and seamless Calendar experience at [Proton](https://proton.me/), and my role involves architecting and implementing features to ensure end-to-end encryption for our iOS platform.

In my spare time, travelling the world and getting close to people from different cultures and backgrounds makes me feel full of energy. I also love practicing numerous sports, playing videogames and learning about finance.
